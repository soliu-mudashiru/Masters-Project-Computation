# Masters-Project-Computation
Find inside resources that I used during my Master's thesis period. 
While I keep developing my skills further, I had to quickly learn vibe coding with ChatGpt using Python Programming language to beat my Master's period deadline.
It assisted a lot after I have taken courses on Python language and read several books on computations employing it.
So while you find resources within this repo useful, you may also need to filter the rigorous trial and error vibe coding session within the code lines.
I do hope some resources here will help aspiring geoscience modellers. Happy coding!
