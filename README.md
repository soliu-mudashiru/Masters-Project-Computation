# Masters-Project-Computation
This repository contains selected computational resources developed during my Master’s thesis research. During this period, I rapidly advanced my programming skills in Python and explored AI-assisted coding with ChatGPT to meet research deadlines and enhance modelling efficiency.
I hope the materials here will be useful to aspiring geoscience modellers who are learning to combine scientific computing with AI-assisted workflows.
Happy coding and modelling!
