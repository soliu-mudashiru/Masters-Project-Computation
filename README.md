# Masters-Project-Computation
This repository contains selected computational resources developed during my Master’s thesis research. During this period, I rapidly advanced my programming skills in Python and explored AI-assisted coding with ChatGPT to meet research deadlines and enhance modelling efficiency.

As a result, you will find my “trial-and-error” coding sessions within the scripts and I believe that reflect a genuine learning journey and also practical implementations of AI-assisted coding in geospatial and hydrologic modelling.

I hope the materials here will be useful to aspiring geoscience modellers who are learning to combine scientific computing with AI-assisted workflows.

Happy coding and modelling!
